# How the recommendations work:

1. After the user login/ register for a new account, a questionnaire window will be prompted.
2. The questionnaire contains questions aimed to access your current mood, and the user can respond to the questions by using the sliders.
3. After the questionnaire is submitted, the user will be given a playlist with 10 songs recommended immediately.
4. After submitting the recommendation page, the user will be directed to the dashboard, where they can see their past recommendation analysis, history and favourites.
5. The user can choose to generate new recommendations from history, which contains their previous recommendations. 
6. As a bonus, the user can visit the "Your Daily Dose of Sertonin" page for motivational quotes!
